👋 Hey there, I’m Praneeth

🎓 I’m currently a second-year student at Amrita University, Bangalore, passionate about diving deep into the world of tech and code. I’ve just wrapped up my first year — and with it, the foundation of a journey filled with curiosity and creativity!

🧠 Always learning. Always building.
I've completed two Google-authorized Coursera courses:

    ✔️ Crash Course on Python

    ✔️ Using Python to Interact with the Operating System

💻 Currently sharpening my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms, I love solving problems and exploring how code connects to real-world logic.

🚀 Whether it's writing clean Python, debugging with determination, or exploring new frameworks, I’m always up for a challenge.
